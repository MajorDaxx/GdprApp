## Purpose
This App should help to keep track of your private data. 
For this purpose you can send easily "GDPR requests for information" Mails to companie you think have data about you .

## HowTo
The way to do so ist quiet simple. 
First register your Email. In this process your SMTP-Email Credetials get stored on your locl device. And only on your local device 
Next you can select any Company you want fro a shown list. 
If you select any company you have to fill the needed personla information an click the send button in the bottom left cornen. 
Tada your request was sended. A info box with the information is shown.

## Stuff

The App sends mail with the java mail sdk for androi: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/Android

This "simple" App could be probably writen with React Native or Flutter to get it to a broader audience.
But it seem to be not so easy to send mail directly with either react or flutter. Further researh need to be done.
